\title{Amino acid pairs with non-negative BLOSUM62 score}
\format{
An object of class \code{character} of length 112.
}
\usage{
data(BlosumVec)
}
\description{
A character vector whose elements are two-letter amino acid pairs (one-letter
code) with a BLOSUM62 substitution score >= 0. Used by the GLIPH2 global
similarity method to restrict edges to positions where differing amino acids
are considered interchangeable. When \pkg{immApex} is installed, this vector
is derived at runtime from the full BLOSUM62 matrix via
\code{.get_blosum_vec()}.
